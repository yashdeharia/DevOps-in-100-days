- `Ctrl + Y`: Paste the last cut text.
- `Ctrl + L`: Clear the screen.

### 🌐 File Downloading:
- `wget http://example.com/file`: Downloaded files from the internet.

### 📊 System Monitoring:
- `top`: Displayed real-time system processes and resource usage.
- `htop`: An enhanced version of `top` with a user-friendly interface.

### 🖥️ System Information:
- `uname -a`: Displayed system information.
- `lscpu`: Showed CPU architecture details.
- `free -h`: Displayed memory usage.
- `vmstat`: Reported virtual memory statistics.

### 🗜️ File Compression:
- `zip archive.zip file`: Compressed files into a zip archive.
- `unzip archive.zip`: Extracted files from a zip archive.

### 👥 User and Group Information:

- `netstat`: Displayed network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

### ✂️ Text Processing:
- `sed 's/old/new/g' file`: Replaced text in a file.
